              INTRODUCTION


              The FY 2016 Capital Commitment Plan, which is to be submitted to the Financial Control Board, totals $11,932 million of which
              $9,753 million is City funded.
                                          In order to achieve this plan the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will authorize agencies to
              commit $16,149 million. For example, the projects which the following 3 agencies are authorized to work on in order to meet their
              FY 2016 targets total the authorized plans for those managing agencies, while the total commitments which have been established as
              their goal equal the managing agency targets - the amounts they are expected to commit.

                      Managing Agency                                          Authorized Plan         Commitment Targets
                                                                                               $ in millions
                      Department of Design and Construction                        $2,688                     $1,723
                      Housing Preservation and Development                         $1,511                       $968
                      Department of Small Business Services                        $1,326                       $850

              The following authorized plan reflects the allocation of the $16,149 million to each capital project.

              Volume 1 of this plan includes a report detailing authorized commitments by capital project within managing agency for FY 2016.
              Also included is a report detailing appropriations and commitments for FY 2016-2019 by project type, along with a current plan and
              forecast of FY 2016 commitments and actual commitments through July.

              The agency commitment targets shown in the commitment plan are the actual aggregate levels that the managing agencies are
              expected to commit and against which their performance will be measured at the end of the fiscal year.
                                                                                                            Since the performance of an
              agency in achieving its goal is independent of the source of funds for the work, commitment targets for each agency are not broken
              down between City and non-City funds.

              In addition, volumes 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this plan contain detailed project status data within budget line, and the appropriation and
              commitment data for FY 2016-2019. The FY 2016 Plan was prepared using detailed project status data provided to OMB by City
              agencies using the on-line Financial Management System (FMS).FMS aggregates the agency data to create the Commitment Plan.
              This plan reflects the current estimate of the status of the City's Capital Program.

              Commitments are defined as awarded contracts registered with the City Comptroller except for certain projects which are performed
              jointly with the State.
                                   Non-City commitments for these projects are recorded when the State advertises the work.

                                 CAPITAL PROGRAM PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

                     This Commitment Plan includes indicators of agencies' performance in executing their capital programs.
              These indicators are also published semi-annually in the Mayor's Management Report.          The tables that follow
              provide a summary and comparison of planned and actual capital program activity as measured by three indicators:

                   Financial Indicators, which report on the total dollar amount of commitments.        Targeted and actual
                    commitments are distributed to the agency responsible for managing each project.

                   Management Indicators, which count the number of projects entering three phases: design start, defined as
                    the commencement of in-house design or the commitment of the project's first consultant design contract;
                    construction start, which is the commitment of the project's first major construction contract or the
                    commencement of in-house construction; and project completion, when the last major construction contract
                    is declared substantially complete.   Equipment purchases are counted as project completions.       A project is
                    generally defined as a particular program of work at a single site.

                   Programmatic Indicators, which measure performance against specific programmatic goals, such as miles
                    of streets resurfaced, neighborhood parks reconstructed, or sanitation trucks purchased.     The table in this
                    report includes project completions for each indicator.

                     All planned amounts are originally based on the September Commitment Plan.          These amounts may be
              adjusted during the year, to account for events beyond an agency's control such as citywide reductions in funding
              or unavoidable construction delays.
